# BankingSystem

Description:
BankingSystem is a Python project that simulates a basic banking system with features such as user registration, login, and transaction management. Designed to provide users with a seamless simple banking experience, this project offers functionalities for depositing money, withdrawing funds, and checking account balances.

Key Features:
- User Registration: Allows new users to create accounts by providing a username and password.
- Login System: Verifies user credentials during login to grant access to account functionalities.
- Transaction Management: Enables users to deposit money, withdraw funds, and view their current balance.
- Data Persistence: Stores user details and transaction records in JSON files for persistent data storage.

Concepts Used:
- File Handling: Utilized file I/O operations to read and write user details and transaction records in JSON format.
- Exception Handling: Implemented try-except blocks to handle errors gracefully and provide informative error messages to users.
- Function Calls: Segmented functionalities into separate functions for better code organization and reusability.
- JSON Serialization: Serialized Python dictionaries into JSON strings for storage and deserialized JSON strings into Python dictionaries for data retrieval.
